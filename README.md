# Homevalue Hunter (Flask App on Heroku)

[App Website](http://homevalue-hunter.herokuapp.com/)

## The Idea
Homevalue Hunter is an app that helps home buyers find locations that are undervalued based on their specific criteria. The idea behind it is that the home price is influenced by a large number of factors, but if we project it down to a small set of features that a user cares about (using linear regression), it will reveal "inefficiencies" (i.e. home prices that are over- or undervalued) that arise from features that users don't care about.
